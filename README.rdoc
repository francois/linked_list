= LinkedList

* http://linkedlist.rubyforge.org/

== DESCRIPTION:

A simple linked list implementation that follows Ruby's conventions.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* FIXME: #dup is implemented by reversing the list twice.  This should be pretty slow...  Untested, not benchmarked.
* This implementation isn't thread safe.

== SYNOPSIS:

  list = LinkedList.new
  list << "a"
  list.push "b"
  list.unshift "c"
  list.inspect
  #=> ("c" ("b" ("a" nil)))
  list.pop
  #=> ("b" ("a" nil))
  list.map {|v| v*2}
  #=> ("bb" ("aa" nil))

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8.6+

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install linked_list
